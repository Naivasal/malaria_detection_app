Requirements:

Libraries and Packages:

os: Operating system interface.

numpy: Library for numerical operations.

PIL: Python Imaging Library for opening, manipulating, and saving image files.

UnidentifiedImageError: Exception for handling unidentified image errors.

sklearn: Scikit-learn library for machine learning tools.

pandas: Data manipulation library.

tensorflow: TensorFlow deep learning framework.

Sequential, Dense, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, InputLayer, Reshape: Keras layers for building neural networks.

matplotlib.pyplot: Library for creating visualizations.

Model Directory Structure:

MalariaDetectionProject

data: Folder containing the malaria dataset.

cell_images: Subfolder containing subdirectories for "Parasitized" and "Uninfected" classes.

models: Folder for storing trained models.

scripts: Folder containing Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and Streamlit app.

app.py: Main script for running the Streamlit app.

requirements.txt: File specifying required Python packages.

Instructions to Run the Code:

Install Required Packages:

Open a terminal.

Navigate to the project directory using cd path/to/MalariaDetectionProject.

Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the necessary Python packages.

Data Preparation and Model Training:

Open a Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment.

Run the script scripts/data_preparation_model_training.ipynb to prepare the data, train the model, and save it to the models directory.

Run Streamlit App:

Ensure that you have Streamlit installed (pip install streamlit).

Run the command streamlit run scripts/app.py in the terminal.

Open the provided URL in a web browser to interact with the Malaria Detection App.

Explore Model Performance:

View the accuracy and loss plots generated during model training in the Jupyter Notebook (data_preparation_model_training.ipynb).

Analyze the results to understand how well the model performed on the training and validation sets.

Adjust Image Size (Optional):

If desired, adjust the image_size variable in the scripts to change the input size for the images.

By following these instructions, you can reproduce the Malaria Detection Project, train the model, and interact with the Streamlit app for malaria detection.
